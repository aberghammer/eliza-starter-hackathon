# Social Score Auto Trading AI: ELYSA

## ElizaOS Starter with Cookie.fun

As part of the Cookie **DeFAI Hackathon**, participating in both the **AI Track** and **Arbitrum Track**, we leveraged the ElizaOS starter repository to develop a custom auto-trading plugin. Our solution enables automated trading on EVM-compatible blockchains like **BASE** and **ARBITRUM**, integrating real-time on-chain data, sentiment analysis, and advanced trading logic to optimize decision-making in decentralized finance.

The AI automatically buys and sells tokens based on predefined trading signals, leveraging market trends, liquidity analysis, and AI-driven sentiment evaluation to maximize profitability while managing risk.

Buys and sells are tweetet in a regularly. Additionally, a bull post engine gives deep insights regarding the current AI token market.

## Actions Included

The following actions are executed within the housekeeping cycle:

- **`openPositions`**: Displays currently open trading positions.
- **`analyzeMarket`**: Analyzes market conditions and sets potential buy or sell signals.
- **`analyzeData`**: Processes market data and trends.
- **`buyToken`**: Executes buy orders based on market conditions.
- **`checkSell`**: Evaluates whether open positions should be sold.
- **`sellToken`**: Executes token sales if conditions are met.
- **`manualBuy`**: Allows manual token purchases.
- **`manualSell`**: Allows manual token sales.
- **`housekeeping`**: The main housekeeping cycle that runs all trading tasks.
- **`tweetMindshare`**: Posts trading insights on Twitter.

## Housekeeping Execution

The `housekeeping` function is responsible for executing the above actions in a structured cycle. It checks whether the process should run as a single task or in a continuous loop based on user input.

### Execution Flow:

1. **Market Analysis:**

   - Runs `analyzeMarket` to scan for potential trades.
   - Runs `analyzeData` to process and refine signals.

2. **Token Trading:**

   - Calls `buyToken` to execute pending buy orders.
   - Calls `checkSell` to evaluate sell conditions.
   - Calls `sellToken` to process sell orders.

3. **Process Completion:**
   - Logs the execution and schedules the next cycle if necessary.

## HousekeepingService Implementation

The `HousekeepingService` class handles the execution of all housekeeping actions. It ensures each step runs sequentially and logs progress.

### Key Methods:

- **`runCycle(runtime, callback?)`**

  - Runs a full housekeeping cycle, performing analysis, trading, and logging.

- **Execution Steps:**
  - Executes market analysis (`analyzeMarket` and `analyzeData`).
  - Processes pending buy and sell orders.
  - Logs and handles errors.

## Configuration

The frequency of housekeeping cycles is defined by `HOUSEKEEPING_MINUTES` in the configuration file. The function checks for the `loop` parameter to determine if it should run continuously.

## Example Usage

A user can trigger housekeeping manually via command input:

}
```

## Conclusion

The `housekeeping` function ensures automated and optimized trading operations, reducing manual intervention and improving trading efficiency. By continuously analyzing the market and executing trades, it keeps the system running smoothly and efficiently.

# Market Analysis and Trading Strategy in Cookie-Fun Plugin

## Overview

The `analyzeData` function is a critical component of the `cookie-fun` plugin, responsible for analyzing market data and determining buy signals based on various key metrics. This function integrates the **Cookie.fun API**, **Dexscreener API**, and **Twitter sentiment analysis** to make informed trading decisions.

## Data Sources Used

1. **Dexscreener API**

   - Provides real-time token price, liquidity, trading volume, and holders count.
   - Used to fetch token price movements and determine market trends.

2. **Cookie.fun API**

   - Analyzes Twitter mentions of a token symbol over a given time range.
   - Helps assess social media activity and mindshare.

3. **Twitter Sentiment Analysis**
   - Evaluates the sentiment of tweets mentioning the token.
   - Determines whether the overall sentiment is bullish or bearish.

## Trading Strategy

The system follows a **data-driven approach** to determine buy signals. The decision-making process involves multiple steps:

### 1. **Market Data Collection**

- The system queries **marketdata key metrics** for token price, liquidity, trading volume, and holders count.

### 2. **Social Sentiment Analysis via Cookie.fun API**

- The system retrieves tweets mentioning the token over the past 24 hours.
- If no relevant tweets are found, the token is not considered for trading.
- If tweets are found, the system conducts sentiment analysis.

### 3. **Buy Signal Evaluation**

The decision to buy a token is based on the following key metrics:

| Metric              | Description                                                               |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Mindshare**       | The number of relevant tweets mentioning the token                        |
| **Liquidity**       | Ensures that the token has sufficient liquidity for trading               |
| **24H Volume**      | Measures the trading activity over the last 24 hours                      |
| **Holders Count**   | Checks the number of unique wallet addresses holding the token            |
| **Price Momentum**  | Detects price trends and volatility                                       |
| **Social Momentum** | Evaluates the trend of social media engagement                            |
| **Total Score**     | A computed score based on all metrics to determine overall attractiveness |

A token is assigned a **buy signal** if it meets the following criteria:

- **High social media engagement** (mindshare)
- **Healthy liquidity and trading volume**
- **Strong price momentum indicating upward movement**
- **Final sentiment check on Tweets via LLM**

### 4. **Database Update and Signal Storage**

- If a token meets the buy criteria, it is stored in the database with a **buy signal**.
- If it does not qualify, no buy signal is assigned.

## Example Execution Flow

1. **User Requests Market Analysis:**

   ```json
   {
     "user": "trader",
     "content": {
       "text": "Can you check if there are any buy signals in our system?"
     }
   }
   ```

2. **System Response:**

   ```json

# Token Sell Execution in Cookie-Fun Plugin

## Overview

The `checkSell` function is responsible for determining whether any active trades should be sold. It evaluates various **profit and risk factors**, ensuring that tokens are sold under optimal conditions.

## Process Flow

1. **Retrieve Active Trades**

   - The system queries the database for all **active trades**.
   - If no active trades exist, the process exits.

2. **Fetch Market Data**

   - The **Dexscreener API** is used to retrieve the latest price for each token.
   - The system checks for **WETH pair prices** to determine current market value.

3. **Calculate Profit/Loss (P/L) Percentage**

   - The **P/L percentage** is computed using:
     ```
     (currentPrice - entryPrice) / entryPrice * 100
     ```
   - A positive P/L indicates profit, while a negative P/L signals a loss.

4. **Evaluate Sell Signals Based on Key Metrics**

   - A token is flagged for selling if **any** of the following conditions are met:

   | Condition                    | Description                                                                              |
   | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **Profit Target Reached**    | If P/L **‚â•** `PROFIT_TARGET`, the system sells to secure profit                          |
   | **Stop-Loss Triggered**      | If P/L **‚â§** `STOP_LOSS`, the system sells to minimize losses                            |
   | **Volume Drop**              | If trading volume has decreased by **50%** or more, it suggests declining interest       |
   | **Negative Social Momentum** | If social media discussions are **overwhelmingly bearish**, the system considers selling |
   | **Strong Price Decline**     | If price momentum is **below -2.0 (Z-Score)**, indicating a sharp downturn               |

5. **Dynamic Trailing Stop-Loss**

   - If the trade is in **strong profit (>20%)**, the system **adjusts the stop-loss** to secure gains.
   - The new stop-loss prevents unnecessary losses if the price suddenly drops.

6. **Update Database and Flag for Sale**

   - If a token meets **sell criteria**, the database is updated:
     - The **sell signal is activated**.
     - The **stop-loss level is adjusted**.
